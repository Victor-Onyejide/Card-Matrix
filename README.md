# Card-Matrix

# Question
# # # Whenever a card is clicked, the card that was previously face up is turned over to face down and the clicked card is turned over to face up. Only one card is ever face up. Face up cards should have content 'up' while face down cards should have content 'down' When an 'up' card is clicked, it remains 'up'.
# # # Write a setup function that registers card click handlers and implements the logic of the HTML widget.
